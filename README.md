# Python-Challenge
# # Pybank and Pypoll analysis
In this project I first start by completing an analysis within a budget dataset that shows the greatest changes within profits and losses. This includes the average of those changes as well as the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in profits.

I then run an analysis of an election dataset that shows a complete list of canadidates who received votes, the percentage of the votes they won, the total amount of votes each of them won and finally the winner of that election. 

Results of this election are shown within the analysis folder.
